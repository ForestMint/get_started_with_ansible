# This is about the basics of Ansible




Start the machines

```bash
cd managed_node_1
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
(sudo useradd -m p851962) && (sudo passwd p851962)
cd ..

cd managed_node_2
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
(sudo useradd -m p851962) && (sudo passwd p851962)
cd ..

cd managed_node_3
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
(sudo useradd -m p851962) && (sudo passwd p851962)
cd ..
```


On the control node

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "jay default"
```
press Enter to leave the file field empty
choose a strong passphrase to make the key much better


find the IPs in the variable /VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/0/V4/IP

```bash

vboxmanage list runningvms # display information about the running VMs

vboxmanage guestproperty enumerate <managed-node-1-name> | grep /VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/1/V4/IP

vboxmanage guestproperty enumerate <managed-node-2-name> | grep /VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/1/V4/IP

vboxmanage guestproperty enumerate <managed-node-3-name> | grep /VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/1/V4/IP


```

ping the IP addresses to check they repond

```bash
ping <managed-node-1-IP>

ping <managed-node-2-IP>

ping <managed-node-3-IP>
```


copy the public key to each server you want to access to
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <server-ip-address>
```

ðŸ¥³ IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO CONNECT TO SERVERS FROM CONTROL NODE WITH SSH !!!!!

No need to have OpenSSH installed on the workstation == control node (just SSH client is needed here, installed by default on any Linux system)





On the control node

Make sure to type a different type from those previously typed for SSH key
Don't create a passphrase
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible"
```

Add the ansible key to all the 3 servers with ssh-copy-id command like higher in this file


Connect to each server with SSH and run the following to check the presence of the 2 keys
```bash
cat .ssh/authoriwed_keys
```

Check the connection with ansible key to each server
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible <managed-node-1-IP>
```
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible <managed-node-2-IP>
```
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible <managed-node-3-IP>
```

Install Ansible

proceed installation

Arch Linux

pacman -S ansible

check success of installation

ansible --version

Run the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_apache.yml
```
